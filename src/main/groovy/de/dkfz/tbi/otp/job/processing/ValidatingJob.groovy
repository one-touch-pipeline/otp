/**
 * Interface for a Job which is allowed to update the state of a previously run Job.
 *
 * This interface can be used to verify that other Job(s) executed successfully or failed. The Job
 * should use its execute method to perform the check. It is possible that the Job execution takes
 * a long time as it has to be checked whether a long-running task finished. In such a case the Job
 * should ensure that it sleeps but never throw an exception due to threading. Remember throwing an
 * Exception will trigger that the Process fails and will require manual interaction.
 *
 * A validating job should never fail. It should always succeed. Because of that it is an
 * EndStateAwareJob. It knows that it succeeded when the end of the execute method is reached.
