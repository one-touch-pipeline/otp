     * Use of FixedDalay to avoid the problem of invocation of the method
     * multiple times parallel. With FixedRate the method can be executed by
     * two thread parallel, because the execution time can take more then one
     * second and therefore the next execution is already triggered before the
     * first execution is finished.
     * And if the second thread execute the numberOfRunningProcesses method in
     * the hasOpenSlot method before the first thread has execute the
     * createProcess method, the second thread pass the check, because the slot
     * is still free. Only after createProcess has finished, the slot is not
     * longer free, but at that time the second thread already has pass the
     * check. And because the HQL query return the same SeqTrack, both threads
     * create for the same seqTrack a process.
     * Using of FixedDelay fix that problem, because the next execution is
     * always after the previous execution has finished.
