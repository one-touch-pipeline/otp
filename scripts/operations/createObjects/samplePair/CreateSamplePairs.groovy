/**
 * Create sample pairs for merging work package given by
 * - pid
 * - first sampleType (use as disease)
 * - second sampleType (use as control)
 * - seqType name
 *
 * Notes:
 * - A mergingWorkPackage has to exist (--> produced bam file)
 * - the analyses only support the seqTypes WES and WGS
 * - The libraryLayout is always paired.
 * - Only bulk seq types are supported.
 * - If a sample pair already exists, it will not be created. Thus the processing status is not reset and no analyses will run.
