/**
 * Script to delete all Processed Data of the selected SeqTracks and withdraw the DataFiles.
 *
 * Deletes:
 *   - Alignments
 *   - Analyses
 *   - view-by-pid links of datafiles
 *
 * The script works in two sections: overview and deletion.
 * Provide the input and select the SeqTracks. Then execute the script for an overview of
 * what SeqTracks and DataFiles are affected.
 * If this is fine, comment out the first DEBUG assert.
 *
 * Execute the script again to get an overview of what will be done with the data.
 * If it does not throw an exception before the second DEBUG assert and what will be done
 * is fine, you can remove the second DEBUG assert and actually delete the data.
 *
 * Execute the generated script after looking over it. It is located in the typical sample
 * swap location, but the path is also printed out at the end.
 *
 * Input:
 *   - a swap label for the deletion script on the filesystem
 *   - the dataFileComment is shown in the comment box on the DataFile details view
 *   - the withdrawnComment is shown in the status table on the DataFile details view and in exports
