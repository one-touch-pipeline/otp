initial data
=============

OTP needs several configuration values to be set in its database.

This needs to be done in the groovy web console.

The scripts used for initialisation are in the 'scripts/rollout' directory.
The values needs to be adapted to the location.

Also the workflows needs to be loaded. The scripts therefore are located 'scripts/workflows'.

The scripts in 'scripts/initialisation' need to be adapted and loaded.
