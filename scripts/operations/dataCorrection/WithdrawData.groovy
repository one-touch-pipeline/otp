/**
 * Script to handle withdrawing data.
 *
 * The scripts allow to select between deletion and withdrawing of bam files and of analysis.
 *
 * For all file changes a bash script is created, which needs to be executed manually.
 *
 * The script does the following:
 * - RawSequenceFile:
 *   - withdraw in OTP
 *   - change unix group for file in run folder
 *   - delete link from viewByPidFolder
 *   - delete link in Well directory, if exist
 * - BamFile (if deleteBamFiles = false)
 *   - withdraw the bam fle in OTP
 *   - change unix group in file system for the bam directory
 * - BamFile (if deleteBamFiles = true)
 *   - delete in in OTP (including analysis)
 *   - delete on file system (including analysis)
 * - Analysis (if deleteBamFiles = false and deleteAnalysis = false)
 *   - withdraw the analysis files in OTP
 *   - change unix group in file analysis directory recursively
 * - Analysis (if deleteBamFiles = true or deleteAnalysis = true)
 *   - delete in in OTP
 *   - delete on file system
 *
 * The script provide a tryRun mode to see, what would be changed.
 * If this is fine,change TryRun to false
 *
 * Execute the generated script after looking over it. It is located in the typical sample
 * swap location, but the path is also printed out at the end.
 *
 * Input: See description of the input variables.
