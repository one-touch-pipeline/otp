# Script to create a local development database
#
# by default, loads the most recent database dump in $LATEST_DUMP_LOCATION into the local otp database.
# to load other dumps, specify a search pattern in $USE_DUMP, like so:
#    USE_DUMP=<SEARCH> ./devScripts/postgres/recreateDatabase.sh
# <SEARCH> can be any substring of a dump-identifier, and is glob-expanded on both ends to find a full dump string.
# when multiple dumps match the search pattern, the youngest match is taken.
# recommended search strings are "YYYY-MM-DD", "allData_YYYY-MM-DD" or "YYYY-MM-DD_hh-mm-ss" (or any part/combination thereof)
#
# examples:
#   ./devScripts/postgres/recreateDatabase.sh                # default: loads most recent dump
#   ./devScripts/postgres/recreateDatabase.sh 2019-02-12
#   ./devScripts/postgres/recreateDatabase.sh allData_2019-02-12
#   ./devScripts/postgres/recreateDatabase.sh 2019-02-12_09-52-22
