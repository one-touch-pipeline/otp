/**
 * This class allows to access a property over multiple objects by name in a safe way.
 *
 * The constructor takes an array of objects to use as potential sources for the field.
 * You can then query all the objects for a property and get a single value or a list
 * of values with getByFieldName and getAllByFieldName respectively.
 *
 * Maps are treated in a special way, in which it does not consider the actual attributes
 * of the object but rather the keys of the Map.
 *
 * The objects are iterated in the order they were given in. Subsequently they have an
 * internal priority, with the first object having the highest.
