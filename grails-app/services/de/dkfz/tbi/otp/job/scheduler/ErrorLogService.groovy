/**
 * Service for logging exceptions to files
 *
 * This Service gets exceptions from jobs and stores them in files.
 * Each job should write each different exception type to a dedicated file.
 * As file name the MD5 sum of job's name and the occurred are taken to ensure this.
 * The content of the files is organized as xml to have a clear structure.
 * If a specific exception occurs several times for each job only the timestamp
 * with the point in time when the exception occurred is appended as exception itself
 * is by definition of the file name completely equivalent to the already stored.
