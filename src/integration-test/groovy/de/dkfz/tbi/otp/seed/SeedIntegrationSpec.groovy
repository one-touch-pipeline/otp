     * All created Objects need to be explicitly removed because the seed-plugin creates them in a
     * different session and thus they would not be rolled back but persisted across all tests.
     *
     * We have noticed that Domains with the mapping setting tablePerHierarchy have issues with bulk
     * operations like delete. The root of this problem seems to be the temporary hibernate tables
     * (prefixed with HT_*) which hibernate uses for these operations.
     * Currently only WorkflowLog and its subclasses are affected by this and we typically do not use
     * updates like this in production or anywhere else. Furthermore we are planning on replacing the
     * seed-plugin with the migration plugin. (see `migrations/changelogs/defaultValues/*`)
     * Because of this we decided to not bother with this issue for now.
     *
     * As these classes are not seeded anyways, we use a check if the Domain even needs to be cleaned
     * in the first place and skip otherwise.
