/**
 * A RestartedProcessingStep is a special ProcessingStep for keeping track of restarted ProcessingSteps.
 *
 * When a ProcessingStep gets restarted an instance of this domain class needs to be created.
 * This class holds a back reference to the original ProcessingStep, so that the complete history
 * of Processing is still available.
 *
 * By using a RestartedProcessingStep for the restart of a ProcessingStep the link between the
 * various ProcessingSteps of a Process are still correct. The original ProcessingStep has it's
 * previous and next links unchanged. The RestartedProcessingStep points to the same previous step
 * as the original one and the next points to the next step run after this one. The previous step's
 * next pointer is adjusted to this instance, so that the link between all previous/next points to
 * the latest executed branch. Nevertheless the connection to the restarted jobs is still present
 * and completely browsable through the original link. Even the information that a branching exists
 * is implicitly available through the instance of this class.
 *

 * @deprecated class is part of the old workflow system
