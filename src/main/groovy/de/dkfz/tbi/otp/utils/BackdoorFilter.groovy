/**
 * Filter to give a configured user access to the web application in development mode.
 *
 * The idea behind this backdoor is that in development mode the developer does not have
 * to login. For that the filter creates a UsernamePasswordAuthenticationToken which is
 * authenticated and has the authority ROLE_ADMIN. With other words: the
 * filter allows full access to the application.
 *
 * As that is quite a security risk the filter ensures that it is only used in development
 * mode. Nevertheless the configuration should also ensure that the filter is only added in
 * development mode, so that it does not even get loaded in production mode. Furthermore it
 * would be best to drop the compiled class from the war file.
 *
 * The filter is controlled by the config options {@link OtpProperty#DEVEL_USE_BACKDOOR} and
 * {@link OtpProperty#DEVEL_BACKDOOR_USER}.
 * The first one controls whether the filter is enabled at all, the second one the user to use.
