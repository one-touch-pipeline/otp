/**
 * A script to update the sampleNames in the SeqTracks.
 * That is sometimes requested after a data swap.
 * The script does not update the MetaDataEntries.
 *
 * It shows warnings if:
 * - the old SampleName could not be found
 * - the old SampleName found multiple times
 * - the new SampleName already exists
 *
 * Per default, it is in the preview mode, which shows only the message.
 * Change @param preView to false to do the actual update.
