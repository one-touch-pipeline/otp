 * Delete of a project or only parts.

 * The scripts supports the check for empty projects, which is enabled by default. In that case the deletion is stopped, if the project already contains
 * fastq files or bam files. Other data like projectInfos, dta's or samples are allowed in empty projects.
 *
 * There scripts supports two modes:
 *   - DELETE_ALL: Delete the project in OTP and delete the entire project directory
 *   - DELETE_SEQUENCING_ONLY: Delete the project data in OTP. That are patient and all depending data in OTP and the sequencing directory in the file system.
 *     the project itself, projectInfos, dta and workflow configuration are kept.
 *
 * Additional it is possible to include the analyses directory in the delete script.
 *
 * Since many project/analysis directories are linked, the delete script create a rm for the path itself and also for the realpath of that.
