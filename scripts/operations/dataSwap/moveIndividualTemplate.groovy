/**
 * Template to move/rename a patient call. It can also change the SampleTypes of the patient and rename the file names.
 *
 * Therefore the following input are needed:
 * - OldProject: The name of the project the patient is in currently
 * - NewProject: The new project name, can be the same if no change is necessary
 * - OldPid: The patient to move or rename
 * - NewPid: the new patient pid, can be the same if the new project is different
 * - Map of all SampleTypes names for the patient.
 *   - OldSampleTypeName: The old sample type name
 *   - NewSampleTypeName: The new sample type name or the same as the old. It may not another existing sampleType Name (Creates an Conflict)
 * - Map of all fastq file names:
 *   - OldFileName: The old name of the fastq file
 *   - NewFileName: The new name of the fastq file. May be empty if it should not change
 * - uniqueScriptName: The name used for the generated scripts. That are a bash script to change the file system and a groovy script for trigger the alignment.
 *
 * You can use multiple 'dataSwapService.moveIndividual' calls in the script, duplicate therefore the call.
